      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>I hope to <strong>never</strong> stop learning. I think that life would be dull if that stopped. I don't know how I could continue living without gaining experience.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm learning German on Duolingo, and I will be learning C# and React through Epicodus.</p>
