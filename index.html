      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>I hope to <strong>never</strong> stop learning. I think that life would be dull if that stopped. I don't know how I could continue living without gaining experience.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm learning German on Duolingo, and I will be learning C# and React through Epicodus.</p>

      <h2>My background<h2>
      <p>I graduated in 2011 from UC Berkeley with a degree in English: Medieval language and literature. Since then I haven't felt like I've had a job where I can be creative. In one job I was <em>proofing</em> someone else's work, as with QA, and ultimately, funneled into admin. Nothing wrong about administrative work, it's just not for me. I didn't see a way for myself to grow in that role.<footer>Within QA, I found myself wanting to be the one who <em>wrote</em> the program, too, not just making sure it does what the programmer says it should.</footer></p>

      <p>With my interest in languages, my desire to create, and previous learning of the field, I think that programming is a good fit for me. At this time I am looking to switch career fields and I think that a track with Epicodus will help me to do this.</p>
